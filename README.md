This repository contains my daily learning progress as I go through Python fundamentals and descriptive statistics — part of my M.Sc. job-ready skill-building plan.

✅ Day 1: Python Setup & Syntax Practiced: print(), input(), type(), type conversions (int, float, complex, str) Learned how to: Use .split() with input() Convert between data types Use comments for documentation

✅ Day 2: Data Structures – Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries Practiced: List operations (append, pop, sort, slicing) Tuple immutability Set properties (no duplicates, basic set operations) Dictionary creation, key-value pairs, get(), update(), keys(), values() Learned differences between these structures and where to use them

✅ Day 3: Conditional Statements Practiced: if, elif, else statements Nested conditions Logical operators: and, or, not Built small programs using conditional logic (e.g., grading system, eligibility check)

✅ Day 4: Loops – for and while Practiced: for loop with range() Iterating over strings and lists while loop with exit conditions Control statements: break, continue, pass Wrote mini-examples like printing patterns, list search, sum calculator ✅ Day 5: Functions Practiced: Creating and calling functions using def Using parameters and return values Wrote modular functions for repeated tasks

✅ Day 6: Random ,Math & Statistics Modules (Additional) Practiced: math module: sqrt, floor, ceil, pow, factorial, pi statistics module: mean, median, mode, variance, stdev, pvariance, pstdev Used both modules in practice scripts to perform calculations and summaries

✅ Day 7: Mini Project1 – Descriptive Statistics Tool This project analyzes a list of numbers entered by the user and outputs key descriptive statistics using only built-in modules (statistics, math).

🧠 Features: Count, Mean, Median, Mode(s) Min, Max, Range Population & Sample Variance and Standard Deviation Quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3), IQR Outlier detection using 1.5×IQR rule 📦 Python Concepts Used: input(), lists, loops, conditionals, and custom functions Built-in modules: math, statistics

✅ Week 1 Mini Project 2: Height Analysis Tool This project collects heights (in cm) of multiple individuals and returns a detailed statistical summary. It also converts each height into meters and inches, and classifies the person as Short, Average, or Tall.

🧠 Features: Count, Mean, Median, Mode Standard Deviation, Min, Max Unit conversion (cm → m and inches) Height classification: < 150 cm → Short 150–170 cm → Average

170 cm → Tall 📦 Python Concepts Used: input(), lists, loops, conditionals, custom functions Built-in modules: math, statistics

📂 File: in both repo python_began and trialprojects

🧪 Sample Output: WELCOME TO THE HEIGHT ANALYSIS TOOL The Entered Dataset Is : [123.98, 145.78, 144.89, 164.89, 175.8, 179.0] ---------HEIGHTS ANALYSIS--------- Numbers Of Individuals: 6 Mean: 155.72 Median: 155.33 Mode: No Mode Standard Deviation: 21.23 Minimum Height: 123.98 Maximum Height: 179.0 Short: 3 Average: 1 Tall: 2

NOTE---'SHORT' is defined as set of individuals with height less than 150 c.m. 'AVERAGE' os defined as the set of individuals with height between 150 annd 170 c.m. 'TALL' is defined as the set of individuals with height greater than 170 c.m.

--------CONVERSION OF HEIGHTS IN METERS AND INCHES-------- ht. in c.m. | ht. in meters | ht. in inches 123.98 | 1.24 | 48.72 145.78 | 1.46 | 57.29 144.89 | 1.45 | 56.94 164.89 | 1.65 | 64.80 175.80 | 1.76 | 69.09 ... With Median Height 155.33 C.M. The Standard Deviation Of Heights From The Mean Is 21.23 C.M. . From This Data It Has Bbeen Also Found That The Tallest Individual From This Data Has Height 179.0 C.M. And The Shortest Individual Has Height 123.98 C.M. Output is truncated.
